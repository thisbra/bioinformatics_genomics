# Bioinformatics

My first approach on bioinformatics specialization. Some Coursera tasks and independent inventions.

Finding Hidden messages on DNA (Week 1 | Bioinformatics I):

    task 1: counts and maps the number of incidences of a gene of your choice

    task 2: using FrequentWords algorithm to analyse vibrio_cholerae's genome and find out most recurring genes.

    task 3: finds out complementary strand of the strand inputed

    task 4: enumerate the position of inputed pattern on genome

    task 5: finding OriC through clumping [INCOMPLETE]

    amino_frq: tells the frequency of DnaA contact with 20 of the amino acids 

Genome Sequencing (Week 2 | Bioinformatics II):

    skew: counts glycine-citosine skewing to indentify position of DNA-polymerase relative to ori

    task 2: numbers of string/genome nucleotide mismatches

    task 3: pattern finding algorithm with mismatch implementation [POSITION]

    task 4: pattern finding algorithm with mismatch implementation [COUNT]  

    task 5: Frequent words application with inputed d mismatches [INCOMPLETE] [ASSISTED BY bla.py]
