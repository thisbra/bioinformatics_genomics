# Bioinformatics

My first approach on bioinformatics specialization. Some Coursera tasks and independent inventions.

WEEK 1:

    task 1: counts and maps the number of incidences of a gene of your choice
    
    task 2: using FrequentWords algorithm to analyse vibrio_cholerae's genome and find out most recurring genes.
    
    task 3: finds out complementary strand of the strand inputed
    
    task 4: enumerate the position of inputed pattern on genome
    
    task 5: finding OriC through clumping [INCOMPLETE]
    
    amino_frq: tells the frequency of DnaA contact with 20 of the amino acids 
    
WEEK 2:

    skew: counts glycine-citosine skewing to indentify position of DNA-polymerase relative to ori
    
    task 2: numbers of string/genome nucleotide mismatches
    
    task 3: pattern finding algorithm with mismatch implementation [POSITION]
    
    task 4: pattern finding algorithm with mismatch implementation [COUNT]  
    
    task 5: Frequent words application with inputed d mismatches [INCOMPLETE] [ASSISTED BY bla.py]
    
WEEK 3:
